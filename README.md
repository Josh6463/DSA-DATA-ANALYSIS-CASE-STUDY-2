SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT TOP 3 Region, SUM(Sales)
    AS TotalSales, 'Top' AS RankGroup
    FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
    GROUP BY Region
    ORDER BY SUM(Sales) DESC
) AS Top3
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT TOP 3 Region, SUM(Sales)
  AS TotalSales, 'Bottom' AS RankGroup
    FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
    GROUP BY Region
    ORDER BY SUM(Sales) ASC

```

I. Explanation
1. Group the data by the region and sum the sales of the data based on the region as totalsales. I also used RankGroup(top and Bottom) to represent the position of the result based on the region sales
2. Union all the two query inorder to combine the various result gotten from the queries into a single table
   
II. Findings

The above Table shows that the regions with the highest sales are;
1. West with (# 3597549.278) total sales
2. Ontario	with (# 3063212.480) total sales
3. Prarie	 with (# 2837304.602)	 total sales
 
And the regions with the lowest(bottom) sales are ;
1. Yukon	with (# 975867.374)	Totalsales
2. Northwest Territories with (#	800847.330	) Totalsales
3. Nunavut	with (# 116376.484) totalsales

Q3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
   
```sql
select Product_Sub_Category,Region,
 sum(Sales) AS OntarioAppliancesTotalsales
 From [KMS Sql Case Study] 
  Where Region = 'Ontario' and  Product_Sub_category = 'Appliances'
  group by Region, Product_Sub_Category
  ```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8570b387-2bbd-4496-bb25-0bd5bdf17240)

I. Explanation
1. Group the data by product_Sub_Category
2. filter it down to the desired Region by using a conditional clause 'where' and 'and' to get the total sale of Appliances in Ontario
3. Sum the sales of Appliances in the Region AS OntarioAppliancesTotalsales

II. Findings

1. The totalsales of Appliance in the Ontario is (# 202346.840)
2. Also found out that Appliances is of the top selling product in Ontario while  I compared its Totalsales With the Totalsales of Products in the Region
   
III. Recommendation/Advice

 I recommend that the company supplies more products under Appliances to Ontario as the count of distinct products under Appliances is 72 which is very low compared to other subs-Category like paper,office Furnishing and many more

 Q4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom
```sql
     select Top 10 Customer_Name,
   Sum(Sales) AS TotalBottomCustomersales
  From [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
  group by Customer_Name 
  Order by TotalBottomCustomersales asc;
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e862aaa2-68f4-47fa-8786-99d44c0104b4)

The below Query shows the breakdown of the various product Purchased by this Bottom Customers in term of sales
```sql
    select Customer_Name, Sum(sales) AS Lowestrevenue,
    Product_Category
  from [KMS Sql Case Study] 
 where Customer_Name IN  (
                select top 10 Customer_Name
				From [KMS Sql Case Study]
                group by Customer_Name
                 Order by sum(sales) Asc
				 )
GROUP BY Customer_Name, Product_Category
ORDER BY Customer_Name, Lowestrevenue asc
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adffa82b-3c97-40e8-ab98-2258ce5e5c91)

I. Explanation
1. Group the data by Customer_Name and Product_category
2. Sum the sales as TotalBottomsales based on the Category and the Customer_Name
3. filter the result by selecting the top 10 and sort it to give the result for      the lowest sales using order by  asc
4. Ran the second query to breakdown the product_Category this Customer_Name falls in and to know the Products they normally purchase

II. Findings

The above tables shows that the Bottom Revenue(sales) by customer_name and the Bottom 10 Customer purchases from the Office Supplies Category and this made Office the Lowest Purchase Product_Category.
This Could be due to low Quality Products,lack of visibliy caused by Inappropriate Marketing Strategy, High product Cost, NO/Low Discount and some other factors.

III. Advise/Recommendation

- I advise the company to review the quality of the products produced under the Office Supplies Category.
- The Company should also track the Progress of the Product_Category in their marketing Strategy and If possible reduces the cost of the Products in the Category.

Q5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?
```sql
      select top 1 Ship_Mode,
       Sum(Shipping_Cost) As Highestshippingcost
        From [KMS Sql Case Study] 
	group by Ship_Mode 
   Order by Highestshippingcost  desc;
```

```sql
     select top 10 (Shipping_Cost) As HighestshippingCost,
    Ship_Mode,Ship_Date
    from [KMS Sql Case Study] 
     group by Shipping_Cost,Ship_Mode,Ship_Date
      order by HighestshippingCost desc
