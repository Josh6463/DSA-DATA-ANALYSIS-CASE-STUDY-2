#### 10. Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer

```sql
      select top 10 Customer_Name,Customer_segment 
     from [KMS Sql Case Study]
     where profit < 0
     group by Customer_Name,Customer_segment
  ```
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748baadf-d48a-4657-92bf-f6c36a3ca72a)
 
I. Explanation

Since there is no Return column in the data given'which could have been the best column to use for the analysis', I assumed that the profit column where there were negative values(loss) could be as a result of the items returned by the customers. The refunds of such Customer will return to be a loss to the organistion based on the cost of production of such Items

II. Findings;

The Table Above shows the list of top 10 Customers that returned Items and the segments those Items belongs to
The second table the Customer_Name with the number of returns and the segment those Items were return to
- this table shows that Most Returned Items belong to the Consumer_segment which could depict that there is something wrong with the quality of Products Under the Consumer Category

       select Order_priority,Ship_Mode,
       count(distinct Order_ID) AS TotalOrder
       From [KMS Sql Case Study]
       Group by Order_priority,Ship_Mode
       order by Order_priority,TotalOrder desc;
      ```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b09e21c4-0437-402f-80ed-cdf0f70ab89e)

#### Findings;
- The company didn't spend shipping costs based on the Order Priority appropriately because Critical,and high priority Order should use the Express Air ship_mode but found out that Most of the Critical and High Priority Order uses the Delivery truck and Regular Air Ship_Mode which amount to the Highestshipping Cost By ship_mode. Orders with Low,and Medium Order_Priority ought to use the Delivery Truck as Ship_mode but some of the low,Medium Order_priority uses the Air Express as The Ship_Mode and this result to inappropriate spending of the Company Revenue.
